# Simplify Your VCF Contacts with vcf-filter-app â€” Only Names and Phone Numbers Retained!

The VCF Filter App is a web-based application designed to clean VCF (vCard) files by filtering out all entries except for those containing phone numbers. It also removes any attached photos from the contacts, ensuring that the output file contains only essential information

For a pure python experience check out [python_executable.py](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Features

- **Upload VCF Files**: Users can upload their VCF files directly through the web interface.
- **Clean and Download**: After processing, users can download the cleaned VCF file, which includes only the contacts with phone numbers.

## Technology Stack

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework used to serve the web interface and handle file uploads and downloads.
- **Python**: The back-end processing of VCF files is handled by Python scripts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
